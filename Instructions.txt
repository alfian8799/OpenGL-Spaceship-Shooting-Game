I created this game as a course project(Computer Graphics) using OpenGL and C++.

Instructions :
1. First install the OpenGL (if you already have it you can skip this step )
  Run the following command to install OpenGL on Ubuntu
  > sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
2. Open the terminal and change your directory to the game directory and run the following command .
  > g++ game.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
3. Have Fun !!!
